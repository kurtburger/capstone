<h6>I: A Speeding Ticket</h6>

	<p>When Ray Kaplan was pulled over about a year and a half ago for speeding in Denver, the police officer approached the driver’s window and asked for Kaplan’s license and registration. Kaplan remembers their conversation beginning with “Sir, you were speeding.”</p>
 
	<p>But Kaplan says that when the officer came back to the car, he seemed frazzled. His ticket-issuing diatribe was uncertain: <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_itwasobvious.wav" data-plays="1">"I don't think he said ‘ma'am,’ I don't think he completely switched it. But it was obvious after he came back that he did not know what I was," Kaplan says. </span> </p> 
 
	<p>Kaplan, who is genderqueer and identifies in the transmasculine wheelhouse, has an X gender marker, instead of an M or an F, on their Colorado driver's license– something that became available for drivers in the state on November 30, 2018. The year prior, in July, Oregon was the first state to offer an X on drivers licenses; today, 19 other states and Washington D.C., all have the X option. </p>
 
	<p>While the number of states offering the X option has increased at the state level, non-binary people of varying identities still question the impact that the third option has on societal conceptions of gender, and whether or not this push for inclusion is effective in preventing discrimination that non-binary people encounter in a binary world.</p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_I_guess_he_was.wav"  data-plays="1">“I guess [the police officer] was trying to maybe approach the car and be like ‘Okay sir, this is what you're going to do next’ sort of thing. But then, after seeing this X on my license, that was no longer the situation,” Kaplan says. </span></p>

	<p>In a mix of optimism and pessimism, Kaplan hoped that the officer might let them go scot-free, but also wondered if the officer was going to react negatively to the out-of-the-ordinary gender marker ID– what if their gender marker had given the officer the opportunity to be discriminatory? Kaplan ended up being issued a $397 ticket.</p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_it_was_a_normal_interaction.wav"  data-plays="1">“It was a normal interaction with the cop besides the fact that, like, it wasn't,” Kaplan said, “I've been pulled over with an F on my license, and I just feel like the way that they talk to you, when they know how to classify you or to categorize you, is a lot different than when it's a little bit more ambiguous.”</span></p>

<h6>II. A Different Option</h6>

	<p>Kaplan chose to change their gender marker to X soon after it became available in Colorado. Despite presenting masculine, they still felt that switching from F to M didn’t represent them completely- they saw the X as neither and both, which resonated with Kaplan.</p>
 
 
	<p>More than forty percent of the LGBTQ population lives in states that allow residents to mark M, F, or X on their driver's license, according to the <a href= "https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/identity_document_laws">Movement Advancement Project</a>, a nonprofit equality-researching thinktank, and this percentage is set to increase in the next few years. New York announced in 2020 that the state intends to include gender neutral options, but the process of updating Department of Motor Vehicle computers to automatically offer X will take more than a year, according to <a href= https://www.syracuse.com/state/2020/11/new-york-to-add-nonbinary-gender-option-x-for-drivers-licenses.html" >Syracuse.com</a>.</p>
 
	<p>New Jersey recently passed the Babs Sipserstein law, which streamlines the process of changing gender markers, removing barriers that exist in many other states like proof of gender-affirming surgery or a provider’s (therapist’s) confirmation. On April 19, the  <a href= https://www.state.nj.us/mvc/press/archives/2021/041921.htm" >New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission</a> released a statement that gender options on drivers licences would extend to include X, and only requires that drivers surrender their current license and pay a standard $11 fee to receive their updated ID. </p>
 
	<p>But Mack Litzenberg, a 22-year-old non-binary person from Florida, believes that having an X on their ID might result in more danger than safety, <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Mack_it_wouldnt_alleviate.wav"  data-plays="1">“It wouldn’t alleviate any dysphoria just because then you would be questioned more. I don’t feel particularly comfortable walking into a space and then automatically being like, ‘Oh that’s a trans person.” </span></p>
 
	<p>Litzenberg has an F on their driver’s license, but feels that changing their gender marker on their ID would have little impact on their life, <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Mack_I_think_the_amount.wav" data-plays="1">“I think the amount of times I've shown my ID to anybody is like, pretty much nothing. Like in the past nine months, I don't think I've ever shown anybody my ID,” Litzenberg said, “I’m just am not that invested in paying the government a lot of money to switch my ID to something so that way they can better identify me, because I don’t really care what the government thinks of me.”</span></p>  
 
	<p>The US Transgender Survey also reported that cost is a barrier that prevents non-binary and trans people from changing their ID documents, with 32% of respondents to the survey stating that they could not afford to change the gender marker.</p>
 
	<p>In Florida, the license replacement fee is $25, but Mack wouldn’t be able to change their gender marker to X even if they wanted to. Changing a binary gender marker with the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles requires a “signed original statement, on office letterhead, from your attending medical physician.” An applicant must also be “undergoing appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition,” according to the <a href= "https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/id/Florida%20Name%20and%20Gender%20Change%20Guide%20FINAL%20Aug%202017.pdf" >Name & Gender Change Guide for Residents of Florida</a>. While Florida no longer requires documented proof of gender-affirming surgeries in order to proceed with a gender change on driver’s licenses, the medical certification has to meet several requisites in order to be approved, including the statement “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States the forgoing is true and correct,” on the physician’s statement.</p>
 
	<p>While Litzenberg doesn’t see the point of changing their gender marker on their ID– and would need to jump over several bureaucratic hurdles to do so– for other gender nonconforming people, the experience can be easy, positive, and deeply affirming.</p>
 
	<p>The requisites for requests for changing markers varies in different states. In Kaplan’s case, changing their gender marker in Colorado was relatively painless. To change the gender marker on Colorado IDs, applicants need to pay a standard fee of $30.87– there is no additional charge for specifically changing the gender marker, according to the <a href= "https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/change-your-sex">Colorado government website</a>. <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_it_was_really_easy.wav"  data-plays="1">“It was really easy; they knew exactly what the form was when I came up with it. Nobody made a real point of it or anything. I felt pretty okay doing it,” Kaplan said.</span></p>
 
	<p>Despite how streamlined the process has become in states like Colorado, the option still doesn’t exist in other states. For the foreseeable future in Indiana, for example, non-binary gender options will not be available unless new legislation passes that specifically permits them, according to the <a href= "https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/identity_document_laws">Movement Advancement Project</a>. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles intended to make the non-binary option available, but Curtis Hill, the Attorney General of Indiana, issued a statement in March 2020 that prohibited the state’s BMV from doing so. In Hill’s <a href= "https://calendarmedia.blob.core.windows.net/assets/78e9c6d3-24cc-4070-aa64-9e69987606c8.pdfs" >official opinion</a>, he states that while these departments have the authority to issue these documents, they do not have the authority to create new categories.</p>
 
	<p>The process in Massachusetts, like Colorado, is more streamlined– here, the Registry of Motor Vehicles requires no supplemental documentation in order to make the switch, according to a <a href= "https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-allows-nonbinary-marker-on-licenses-ids">press release by the Massachusetts government</a>. Electra May, a gender nonconforming person from Massachusetts and recent graduate of The New School, changed their gender marker to X in November 2019, becoming one of the first people in the state to do so. The option to change their gender marker also became an opportunity to come out to their mother, who accompanied them on their visit to their local RMV. <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Electra_very_nice_moment.wav" data-plays="1">“It was a really nice moment for us, I think. I don't know how I would have handled that if she was not as open to me in that way, but it was a very life-changing day for sure.” May said.</span>
 
	<p>Up until changing their gender marker, May hadn’t always been so vocal about their gender identity, thinking that it might not be received well, but found changing their gender marker to an X particularly affirming: <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Electra_Theres_something_nice.wav" data-plays="1">“There's something kind of undeniably nice about having a government document that actually backs up this thing that you're telling people that you are,” May said. “Even if I'm not pulling out my license to prove to somebody anything, it definitely gives me some peace of mind for sure.”</span></p>

<h6>III. A Genuine Fear</h6>

	 <p>Despite having an X their IDs, both Kaplan and May recognize that it’s not an entirely foolproof way to be visibly non-binary, or to escape being misgendered or experience discrimination.</p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Electra_socialmechanic.wav" data-plays="1">“It doesn't encapsulate everything, and it doesn't do all the work,” May said, “You still have to become a social mechanic of sorts to make sure spaces are welcoming to you. You have a lot of work to do even if you have the X, like that doesn't really change how people treat you.” </span></p>
 	
	<p>While X markers are explicitly neither male or female, the non-binary experience is diverse and many people identify within the non-binary umbrella differently. While some non-binary individuals use singular they pronouns, other non-binary people are more comfortable <a href= "https://www.diversitycenterneo.org/about-us/pronouns/">using several pronouns</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Even without an X on an ID, presenting with any gender ambiguity can lead to feeling unsafe. While Kaplan has not yet been to an airport with the X on their ID, past experiences with the Transportation Security Administration have made Kaplan fear for their safety.</p>  
 
	<p>The official <a href= "https://www.tsa.gov/transgender-passengers">TSA website</a> says that screening is conducted without a regard to a person’s gender identity and a <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SLI3Q1bIrs&feature=emb_title">TSA Cares</a> video states that TSA officers designate a gender for advanced imaging technology based on how individuals present themselves: male or female. In reference to prosthesis that may trigger an alarm in a screening, the video states that “TSA officers are trained to resolve the alarm, not the individual.”</p>
 
	<p>For Kaplan, the experience of having the scanner’s alarm raised is frightening. In an instance where Kaplan’s breasts triggered an alarm during a scan set to the male setting–even though they had an F on their ID at the time–a male TSA officer patted them down, adhering to the <a href= "https://www.tsa.gov/transgender-passengers">TSA policy</a> that states that pat-downs “will be conducted by an officer of the same gender as you present yourself.” During the pat-down procedure, the officer stopped and told Kaplan that they needed a female officer.</p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_those_are_situations.wav" data-plays="1">“Those are situations where I feel incredibly unsafe, because it's like, what am I supposed to do? Walk into the scanner be like, ‘Hi, I'm trans, I'm pre-op this, pre-op that,’ that is an invasion of my privacy, it's also none of their business,” Kaplan said, “You have a male presenting person who has the anatomy of a female, such is a trans person, what do you do when the person who is in charge of your ‘safety’ is unknowledgeable and uneducated?” </span></p>
 
	<p>In a recent report by <a href= "https://www.propublica.org/article/tsa-transgender-travelers-scanners-invasive-searches-often-wait-on-the-other-side">ProPublica</a>, most of the 174 trans respondents reported mistreatment by TSA officers, involving degrading and invasive searches– and only 14 of them filed complaints.</p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_transphobic_individual.wav" data-plays="1">“It's all about who's on the other end of that scanner, like, say, like some transphobic individual was the person who was like the one conducting the scan all of a sudden they realize that this person's trans. At that point do I fear my safety?” Kaplan said.</span></p>
 
	<p>Transgender people disproportionately experience discrimination and violence. 48% of the respondents to the <a href= "https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS%20Full%20Report%20-%20FINAL%201.6.17.pdf">2015 United States Transgender Survey</a> stated that they suffered physical violence, unequal treatment, and/or verbal harassment specifically for being transgender, and 47% of respondents have been sexually assaulted. At least 41 transgender and gender nonconforming individuals have been killed in 2020, according to the <a href= "https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2020">Human Rights Campaign</a>, arking 2020 as the deadliest year on record for transgender and gender nonconforming individuals, according to the <a href= "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/marking-the-deadliest-year-on-record-hrc-releases-report-on-violence-against-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-people">HRC</a>– surpassing 2017, which had a reported 31 violent deaths. </p>
 
	<p>Transrespect Versus Transphobia Worldwide, a research project initiated by the advocacy network Transgender Europe, <a href= "https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-update-tdor-2020/">stated on Trans Day of Remembrance</a> that 350 trans and gender-diverse people were murdered worldwide over the past year, but that this data is incomplete due to underreporting and misreporting of murders involving trans people. </p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Ray_what_if_it_was_different_2.wav" data-plays="1">“I think a lot of my situations, none of them are that bad. But it's like, what if I wasn't so lucky?” Kaplan says, “With TSA I had been very lucky that they let me go, but at the same time, what if it was different?”</span></p>

	<p>The <a href= "https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf">2015 United States Transgender Survey</a> states that nearly one-third of respondents to the survey have been “verbally harassed, denied benefits or service, asked to leave, or assaulted” as a result of IDs not matching their gender presentation.</p>

	<p>In spite of the growing number of states that are including X options in drivers licences across the United States, a rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation has slated 2021 to surpass 2015 as the “worst year for anti-LGBTQ legislation in recent history,” according to the <a href= "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/2021-slated-to-become-worst-year-for-lgbtq-state-legislative-attacks">ACLU</a>, which documents over anti-LGBTQ 250 bills that have been introduced across the U.S. in 2021 so far. <p>

	<p>In Arkansas, a state where <a href= "https://www.intomore.com/impact/arkansas-yes-arkansas-quietly-begins-issuing-gender-neutral-ids-to-non-binary-people/?fbclid=IwAR3prhVA5xYYNjfIym-zqQtcjHKekNj329jZgYBNb-LnvjUoezCtIAwUInE">X is an option</a> on drivers licences, a <a href= "https://legiscan.com/AR/text/HB1570/2021">bill</a> was passed in April that would ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The bill states “Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex,” and that the majority of children who experience “distress” with their biological sex “come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most 6 physiological interventions unnecessary.” Arkansas has more anti-LGBTQ laws than any other state, according to the <a href= "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/2021-slated-to-become-worst-year-for-lgbtq-state-legislative-attacks">ACLU</a> and is the only state to have a medical care ban passed into law.
	</p>

	<p>Half of the anti-LGBTQ bills introduced in 2021 are specifically ant-trans, according to the <a href= "https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/2021-slated-to-become-worst-year-for-lgbtq-state-legislative-attacks">ACLU</a>, and different states specifically restrict trans youth from participating in sports and permit businesses to disallow transgender individuals from using bathrooms.</p>

	<p>In Tennessee, changing a gender marker requires a “statement from the attending physician that necessary medical procedures to accomplish the change in gender are complete,” according to <a href= "https://publications.tnsosfiles.com/rules/1340/1340-01/1340-01-13.20160428.pdf">The Rules of Tennessee Department of Safety Division of Driver License Issuance</a>. On May 19, Governor Bill Lee signed Senate Bill <a href= "https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0126">0126</a>, which prohibits gender-affirming medical care to minors. This new law, along with the preexisting requirements for gender change, effectivley prohibits non-binary minors from changing their gender markers. </p>

	<p>During President Biden’s <a href= "https://joebiden.com/lgbtq-policy/">campaign</a>, he pledged to ensure “all transgender individuals have access to identification documents that accurately reflect their gender identity,” no such action has yet to occur- prompting the ACLU to launch a <a href= "https://action.aclu.org/send-message/president-biden-accurate-ids-all-now">petition</a>, which has nearly reached its goal of 75,000 signatures, encouraging Biden to sign an executive order to fulfill his pledge. </p>

	<p>The petition pushes for an executive order to include the ability of self-attestation, which would allow people to self-identify without medical verification, and the addition of X markers to all federal IDs and records. The ACLU emphasizes the harassment and danger trans and non-binary individuals face when presenting an ID that does not match with their presentation.</p>

	<p>During President Biden’s <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-AqSYODI-Y">first joint address</a> to Congress on April 28, he stated, "To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially the young people. You’re so brave. I want you to know your president has your back."</p>

	<p>On May 10, the Biden Administration released a <a href= "https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/05/10/hhs-announces-prohibition-sex-discrimination-includes-discrimination-basis-sexual-orientation-gender-identity.html">statement</a> enforcing federal protections of transgender and all LGBTQ from discrimination in healthcare: “It is the position of the Department of Health and Human Services that everyone – including LGBTQ people - should be able to access health care, free from discrimination or interference, period.” said Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<h6>IV. A Possible Solution</h6>

	<p>Official recognition of transgender people through the process of changing gender on identification documents has loosened a screw in the well-oiled machine of national identity– and the data it produces. Because there is now a significant population of individuals who identify and present contrary to the gender marker on their ID, the significance of having such markers may be waning.</p>
 
	<p>As states requalify what it means for a person to identify–by means of an identification document–as one gender or none at all, the purpose of having a gender marker at all has been called into question: “Clearly, gender is not irrelevant in people’s lives, but it also frequently operates in contexts where it is an ineffective proxy for determining some other piece of information,” writes Dean Spade, in their 2008 article <a href= "http://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/documenting.pdf" >Documenting Gender</a>. </p>
 
 	<p>Charlie Pollard-Durodola, a genderqueer person and law student at the University of California, Los Angeles, believes that a conversation surrounding gender markers on IDs should address larger concerns of being identified in general: <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Charlie_what_else_is_an_ID.wav" data-plays="1">“What else is an ID besides the ability to create people as statistics with a particular purpose in use, by transforming bodies into useful objects?” said Pollard-Durodola.</span></p>

	<p>Identification documents in the United States are a relatively new creation– gaining significant traction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Social Security numbers and required birth certificates were met with resistance at first but “incentives to encourage birth registration were important to making it the norm,” according to Spade in <a href= "http://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/documenting.pdf" >Documenting Gender</a>.</p>
 
	<p>One of the most significant forms of identification documents in the United States is the Social Security card. Originally intended to provide income support for senior citizens, the creation of Social Security created an unprecedented system of identification for Americans when first introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. The Social Security Administration has grown significantly since its conception and now encompasses several social services including retirement, disability, and survivor benefits.</p>
 
	<p>Although a physical Social Security card does not display gender markers, the Social Security Administration keeps records on the information, including gender, of card holders- this information is used for statistical and research purposes, according to the <a href= "https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/social-security" >National Center for Transgender Equality</a>. And up until <a href= "https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0110212200">2013</a>, card holders were required to show proof of gender-affirming surgery in order to change gender on record with the SSA, but a letter from a physician that proves gender change is still required. </p>
 
	<p><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Charlie_recognition_extemely_minisculewav.wav" data-plays="1">“Recognition and being able to designate who is what and what is who is extremely important to doling out violence,” said Pollard-Durodola, “The idea that that incredible violence could be rectified by an ID marker is extremely miniscule.” </span></p>
 
	<p>A possible solution is the eradication of the gender categories on identification documents. In <a href= "http://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/documenting.pdf" >Documenting Gender</a>, Dean Spade argues that photos included on IDs most reliably prove the identity of the person who carries it. Photos have made the purpose of gender markers and all other information categories on IDs, like hair color, obsolete:  “Given the other information on DMV ID, using gender as a method of identity verification does not provide benefits that outweigh its limitations,” writes Spade. </p> 
 
	<p>When May was about 11 or 12, they noticed that their aunt’s driver’s license erroneously said M, which she hadn’t noticed until May pointed it out: <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Electra_peace_of_mind_mechanism.wav" data-plays="1">“It's a kind of a small letter, and people don't necessarily notice it as much as you think they would.” May said, “I don't know if it's more of a peace of mind mechanism for some, for me, it was a thing that I thought people may notice more than they actually did.”</span></p>
 
	<p>No matter how widely-spread the inclusion of X alongside M and F becomes, an X does not provide indomitable security or safety. Making the gender binary into trinary does not radically shift society’s perception of gender, or ideas as to how it should be documented: <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kurtburger.github.io/capstone/Mack_fantasy_world.wav"  data-plays="1">“I think especially in terms of like a non-binary marker, I don't know that it would provide that safety net of being like, ‘Yeah this is what it says on my ID, so stop questioning me about this, like, leave me alone,’” said Litzenberg, “In my ideal fantasy world, it just wouldn't be there, and if I did decide to put an X on there, it just has to be the situation that nobody cared.”</span></p>
